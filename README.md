# nRK
Experimental blockchain in Go

This is a new blockchain project.  The goal is to build a market-definable, 
permission-based (optional) blockchain that is fully-customizable via Go modules.
It will also be able to gateway to other blockchains in order to settle accounts or
run contracts (as with ethereum).

The goal is to establish a set of building blocks that permit easy construction of
a blockchain or transaction chain (along with network) that is customized to meet the
needs of a community.

This is a work in progress.

Plans

+ Permission-based Account system
+ P2P JSON RPC
+ on-chain services/application extensions in Go
+ Transaction Priority Weighting
+ Proof of Work (1RK)
+ gateway to other networks
+ query-out services
+ Clients in Go, Python

Later variations, possibly

+ Proof of Stake (2RK)
+ Delegated Proof of Stake (3RK)
+ Goodwill and Contribution Scoring/Weighting
+ Proof of Authority
+ Proof of Influence
+ Client in Javascript
