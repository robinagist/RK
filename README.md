Experimental blockchain in Go

This is a new blockchain project.  The goal is to build a market-definable, 
permission-based (optional) blockchain that is fully-customizable via Go modules.
It will also be able to gateway to other blockchains in order to settle accounts or
run contracts (as with ethereum).

This is a work in progress.
