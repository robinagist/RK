# nRK
Experimental blockchain in Go

This is where I learned Go and the inner workings of how a PoW blockchain functions.  It works, but needs a P2P layer to make it interesting.

Possible Plans

+ P2P JSON RPC
+ Proof of Work (1RK)
+ gateway to other networks
+ query-out services
+ Clients in Python, JS

Later variations, possibly

+ Proof of Stake (2RK)
+ Delegated Proof of Stake (3RK)
+ Goodwill and Contribution Scoring/Weighting
+ Proof of Authority
